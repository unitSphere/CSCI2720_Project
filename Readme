The Chinese University of Hong Kong places very high importance on honesty in academic work submitted by students, and adopts a policy of zero tolerance on academic dishonesty. While "academic dishonesty" is the overall name, there are several sub-categories as follows:

(i)	Plagiarism
(ii)	Undeclared multiple submissions
(iii)	Buying or selling, possibly through third parties, papers/essays/dissertations
(iv)	Violating rules 15 or 16 of the University’s Rules to be Observed by Candidates at Examination Centre (Examination Rules) (Annex)
(v)	Cheating in tests and examinations (including violation of rules 17 or 18 of the University’s Examination Rules)
(vi)	Impersonation fraud in tests and examinations (including violation of rule 19 of the University’s Examination Rules)
(vii)	All other acts of academic dishonesty
Any related offence will lead to disciplinary action including termination of studies at the University.

Everyone should make himself/herself familiar with the content of this website and thereby help avoid any practice that would not be acceptable.
